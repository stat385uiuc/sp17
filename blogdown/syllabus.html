<div id="course-description" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>The world is rapidly evolving to rely on data driven decisions. These decisions come from the work a statistician or data scientist presents in his or her reports. In order to present an analysis, the analyst needs to be able to leverage computing resources through programming to unearth patterns and models that exist within data sets. As a result, statisticians and data scientists must be savvy to programming methods that are useful to the wide variety of analysis that they will be expected to perform.</p>
<p>For the focus of the course, fundamental programming techniques and considerations will be introduced. Students will learn one of the leading statistical programming languages in depth and will be well positioned to easily learn others based on general principles. With this in mind, the course provides a framework for writing statistical algorithms through the creation of functions and object oriented programming. Students will also create dynamic reports that encapsulate their code.</p>
</div>

</ul></li>
<li>Motivation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have taken a higher-level course, e.g. STAT 400 or STAT 425, this satisfies the STAT 200 requirement.</p>
</div>
<div id="email-policy" class="section level1">
<h1>Email Policy</h1>
<p>All questions related to this class should be asked on piazza except for private issues (e.g. missing exams). Note that posting anonymous questions on piazza is not <strong>allowed</strong>.</p>
<p>All course emails must contain in the subject line <code>[STAT 385]</code> followed by a description of the e-mail’s contents and should be sent from an <code>@illinois.edu</code> email address. Failure to adhere to this policy will either result in:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>An automated message as a reminder of this policy;</li>
<li><strong>The email is ignored.</strong></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="bug-bounty-program" class="section level1">
<h1>Bug Bounty Program</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer.”</p>
<p>— <strong>Paul R. Ehrlich</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The course staff is a <em>human</em>. As a result, they will sometimes introduce <em>bugs</em> as material becomes transcribed into a computer. Though, the course staff will try their very best to minimize the amount of <em>bugs</em> in the course material. If he does create a <em>bug</em>, please let him know. Depending on the severity, you will be compensated with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Severe: Unintentionally, part of the code is fundamentally flawed.
<ul>
<li>Fix and/or patch is <em>required</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Reward:</strong> Bug Hall of Fame and 1 E.C. point</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Medium: Logical flaws that occur during class.
<ul>
<li>Must explain the flaw and a potential solution</li>
<li><strong>Reward:</strong> Large candy bar of your choice</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trivial: Typos and Grammar
<ul>
<li>Minor nuisances that if corrected via a pull request will be appreciated.</li>
<li><strong>Reward:</strong> For every 20 typos and grammar bits a large candy bar of your choice</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>As an added plus, there are many good discussions that arise due to mistakes…</p>
</div>
<div id="attendence" class="section level1">
<h1>Attendence</h1>
<p>You are expected to attend all lectures. Each lecture will have its own magic word that you are responsible for entering into a form link that will be provided on piazza. In order to be eligible to receive attendance points, you must be <em>in class</em>, enter the magic word within 5 minutes after it is given, and stay for entire duration of class. Periodically, checks will be performed to verify the attendance. Students who have entered the magic word but are not present, will fail class and will have an academic integrity violation opened against them. Please note, every student is eligible to miss <em>four</em> class periods without needing to provide a reason. Any known or potential extracurricular conflicts should be discussed in person with the instructor during the first week of classes, or as soon as they arise. Please be proactive.</p>
<p>The exact method that we will use to calculate attendance at the end of the semester is given by:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_attendence = function(N, N_max){
    round( min( c( 1, N/(N_max - 4) ) )*100, 2)
}</code></pre>
<p>where <code>N</code> denotes the number of times a student has attended class and <code>N_max</code> denotes the maximum number of classes where attendence was taken.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercises" class="section level1">
<h1>Exercises</h1>
<p>There will be <em>no</em> formal homework assignments this semester. Instead, there will be <strong>five</strong> to <strong>eight</strong> different excerise sets that will be made available throughout the semester that students are highly encouraged to do. Please note, that the exercises are done without a solution key being made available.</p>
</div>
<div id="exams" class="section level1">
<h1>Exams</h1>
<p>There are <strong>two</strong> exams for this course. The first exam is a midterm that is worth <strong>20%</strong> and the second exam is a final exam worth <strong>25%</strong> that takes place at 8:00-11:00 a.m. on Monday, May 8. The midterm and final exam <em>may</em> have a take-home portion in addition to a traditional in class examination. In such cases, the take-home portion would be due within 24-48 hours after the start of the exam. The take-home portion of the exam may not be discussed with your classmates.</p>
</div>
<div id="group-project" class="section level1">
<h1>Group Project</h1>
<p>During the semester, students are expected to work on a capstone project within a group. The capstone project is meant to either showcase a newly implemented statistical algorithms OR extend existing functions in pre-existing packages. Examples of past group projects have included: Data Cleaning Shiny Application, LinkedIn Connection Scrapper and Network Visualizer, and Visualization Support for Probability Distributions. Students should choose a topic that interests them but is reasonable to complete within the scope of the class. Due to the amount of projects and the individual demands of each group’s project, the course staff will only provide <em>advice</em> – not code – during Office Hours. Failure to have a working project by the time of the final presentation day will result in a severe penalty.</p>
<p>The groups will be created using the <a href="http://info.catme.org/">CATME</a> system. The use of this system is meant to create <strong>strong</strong> groups that are able to effectively work together. Specifically, students will be grouped together by leadership styles, schedule availability and skill level. Each group will have between 3 to 5 students.</p>
<p>There are four different phases of the group project: <strong>Project Proposal Presentation</strong>, <strong>Progress Report Presentation</strong>, <strong>Final Project Presentation</strong>, and <strong>Final Project Report</strong>. Each of the phases is worth <strong>10%</strong> making the overall project grade <strong>40%</strong> of the course total. At the end, students will be asked to perform peer evaluations of group members that may influence the grades of students who do not contribute equally to the group project. As a results, students should view project grades as being tentative.</p>
<div id="project-proposal-presentation" class="section level2">
<h2>Project Proposal Presentation</h2>
<p>The project proposal presentation must be <strong>5 - 7 minutes</strong> in duration and consist of no more than 12 slides (not including reference slides).</p>
<p>Within the group project proposal, students should answer the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Problem / Topic:</strong>
<ul>
<li>What problem or topic are you addressing?</li>
<li>Why is it interesting or important?</li>
<li>What evidence supports this conclusion?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Idea:</strong>
<ul>
<li>What is your idea for addressing the problem or topic?</li>
<li>Why is it original relative to prior work?</li>
<li>Where did the idea come from?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Relevance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>How does your idea match with the course’s focus on statistical programming?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Method:</strong>
<ul>
<li>What is your general plan for realizing the idea?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feasibility:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Is this project able to be completed before the end of the semester?</li>
<li>What steps must occur to complete the project before the end of the semester?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Time Schedule and Work Division:</strong>
<ul>
<li>What is the work plan to accomplish the necessary tasks before the end of the semester?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Preliminary Work:</strong>
<ul>
<li>What have you done or learned anything so far for the project?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>References:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Provide a list of papers or items you have read to write this proposal.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="progress-report-presentation" class="section level2">
<h2>Progress Report Presentation</h2>
<p>The project progress report presentation up should describe the present status of the project. The progress presentation must be <strong>5 - 7 minutes</strong> in duration and consist of no more than 12 slides. Specifically, the slides should address the following points:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How is the project progressing?</li>
<li>What has been accomplished thus far?</li>
<li>What have you learned?</li>
<li>What issues have arisen?</li>
</ol>
<p>Please <strong>avoid</strong> including code snippets. However, clear functional output is okay.</p>
<p>The score for the progress report is based on how much work has been completed since the project proposal was initially submitted.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-project-presentation" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Project Presentation</h2>
<p>There will be 15 minutes during class that is allocated to the presentation of your project. Please focus on the outcomes of the project. The score is based solely on how well the project outcomes and methods used are conveyed. There should be no more than 12 slides (not including references) in the presentation.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-report" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Report</h2>
<p>Please prepare the final report using the following outline:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Related Work</li>
<li>Method</li>
<li>Results</li>
<li>Discussion</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
<li>References</li>
</ol>
<p>Reports will be graded based upon project outcomes, the execution of methods described, and writing quality.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="software" class="section level1">
<h1>Software</h1>
<p>The course will use and present the <strong>R</strong> statistical computing language as well as different parts of C++ through <a href="http://gallery.rcpp.org/">Rcpp</a>. The integrated developer environment that we will use to explore <em>R</em> is <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/">RStudio IDE</a> made by <a href="https://www.rstudio.com">RStudio Inc</a>. You are free to use any language you choose, but the course staff will only be able to provide support for <strong>R</strong>. If you would like to use another statistical computing environment, please alert the instructor ASAP to discuss feasibility.</p>

</div>
<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level1">
<h1>Academic Integrity</h1>
<p>The official University of Illinois policy related to academic integrity can be found in Article 1, Part 4 of the Student Code. <a href="http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-402.html">Section 1-402 in particular outlines behavior which is considered an infraction of academic integrity.</a> These sections of the Student Code will be upheld in the STAT 385 classroom. Any violations will be dealt with in a swift, fair and strict manner.</p>
<p>You may discuss methods for completing the exercise assignments with other students, but the execution of these methods and the preparation of the document must be done independently. Sufficient evidence of sharing results, collaborating on written assignments, or simply relying on internet resources will result in a score of 0 for the assignment. There can be no discussion with other students or collaboration of any kind on the take-home exams.</p>
<p>To ensure that you do not violate the academic integrity policies, all code and solutions should be prepared yourself. All code should be typed yourself, <strong>not</strong> copy and pasted. (Except for code provided in class or in the textbook.)</p>
</div>
<div id="changes" class="section level1">
<h1>Changes</h1>
<p>The instructor reserves the right to make any changes he considers academically advisable. Such changes, if any, will be announced in class. Please note that it is your responsibility to attend the class and keep track of the proceedings.</p>
