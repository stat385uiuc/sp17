These decisions\ncome from the work a statistician or data scientist presents in his or her \nreports. In order to present an analysis, the analyst needs to be able to \nleverage computing resources through programming to unearth patterns and models\nthat exist within data sets. As a result, statisticians and data scientists must\nbe savvy to programming methods that are useful to the wide variety of analysis\nthat they will be expected to perform.\n\nFor the focus of the course, fundamental programming techniques and \nconsiderations will be introduced. Students will learn one of the leading\nstatistical programming languages in depth and will be well positioned to easily\nlearn others based on general principles. With this in mind, the course provides\na framework for writing statistical algorithms through the creation of functions\nand object oriented programming. Students will also create dynamic reports that\nencapsulate their code.\n\n# Course Objectives\n\nAfter completing the course, students should be able to:\n\n- Analyze and discuss the meaning behind lines of code;\n- Construct implementations of a statistical algorithm within a statistical \n  computing environment;\n- Explain fundamental computing theory as it applies within the domain of \n  Statistics.\n\n# Course Content\n\nTentative subjects include:\n\n- **Paradigms:** R, C++ (using Rcpp), OpenMP, Bash, git, regex;\n- **Reproducible Research:** `knitr`, `rmarkdown`, and `packrat`;\n- **Computing Theory:** Control logic, scoping logic, big O, data structures, object-oriented programming;\n- **Algorithms:** SLR, MLR, ANOVA, Accept-Reject, Probability Integral Transform;\n- **R packages:** Construction of R-packages using `devtools`, `roxygen2`, `profvis`, and `testthat`;\n- **Visualizations:** Exploratory Data Analysis with Base R and `ggplot2`.\n\n# Textbooks\n\nPlease note that these textbooks are legally available online for free.\nIf you wish to purchase a paper copy, you are more than welcome to obtain one. \nHowever, the references throughout the course will be primarily based upon\nthe electronic versions.\n\nThe following texts will be heavily referenced:\n\n- **Required:** [Advanced R Programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) Hadley Wickham\n- **Required:** [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham\n- **Required:** [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf) Patrick Burns\n\nThe following textbooks are *helpful*, but not necessary to succeed in the course:\n\n- **Supplemental:** [Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R](http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~odj/Teaching/MAST30025/spuRs_reformatted_part1.pdf) Owen Jones, Robert Maillardet, and Andrew Robinson\n- **Supplemental:** [An introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf) Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat\n- **Supplemental:** [The Art of R Programming](http://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/vf-uiu/Record/uiu_6955421) Norman Matloff\n- **Supplemental:** [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) Hadley Wickham\n- **Supplemental:** [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis [2nd Edition - GitHub Only]](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book) Hadley Wickham\n\n# Prerequisites\n\nPrior to taking this course, one should have acquired the following knowledge:\n\n* [STAT 200: Statistical Analysis](http://catalog.illinois.edu/courses-of-instruction/stat/)\n* Ability to collaborate in a group project\n    * Listen, provide *constructive* dialog, contribute work\n* Motivation\n\n**Note:** If you have taken a higher-level course, e.g. STAT 400 or STAT 425, \nthis satisfies the STAT 200 requirement.\n\n# Email Policy\n\nAll questions related to this class should be asked on piazza except for private\nissues (e.g. missing exams). Note that posting anonymous questions on\npiazza is not **allowed**.\n\nAll course emails must contain in the subject line `[STAT 385]` followed by\na description of the e-mail's contents and should be sent from an \n`@illinois.edu` email address. Failure to adhere to this policy\nwill either result in:\n\n1. An automated message as a reminder of this policy; \n2. **The email is ignored.**\n\n# Bug Bounty Program\n\n> \"To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer.\" \n>\n> --- **Paul R. Ehrlich**\n\nThe course staff is a *human*. As a result, they will sometimes introduce *bugs*\nas material becomes transcribed into a computer. Though, the course staff will \ntry their very best to minimize the amount of *bugs* in the course material. \nIf he does create a *bug*, please let him know. Depending on the severity, you \nwill be compensated with:\n\n* Severe: Unintentionally, part of the code is fundamentally flawed.\n    * Fix and/or patch is *required*.\n    * **Reward:** Bug Hall of Fame and 1 E.C. point\n* Medium: Logical flaws that occur during class.\n    * Must explain the flaw and a potential solution\n    * **Reward:** Large candy bar of your choice\n* Trivial: Typos and Grammar\n    * Minor nuisances that if corrected via a pull request will be appreciated. \n    * **Reward:** For every 20 typos and grammar bits a large candy bar of your choice\n\nAs an added plus, there are many good discussions that arise due to mistakes...\n\n# Attendence\n\nYou are expected to attend all lectures. Each lecture will have its own\nmagic word that you are responsible for entering into a form link that will be \nprovided on piazza. In order to be eligible to receive attendance points, you\nmust be _in class_, enter the magic word within 5 minutes after it is given, \nand stay for entire duration of class. Periodically, checks will be performed to\nverify the attendance. Students who have entered the magic word but are not \npresent, will fail class and will have an academic integrity\nviolation opened against them. Please note, every student is eligible to miss \n*four* class periods without needing to provide a reason. Any known or potential\nextracurricular conflicts should be discussed in person with the instructor \nduring the first week of classes, or as soon as they arise. Please be proactive.\n\nThe exact method that we will use to calculate attendance at the end of the\nsemester is given by:\n\n```r\nmy_attendence = function(N, N_max){\n    round( min( c( 1, N/(N_max - 4) ) )*100, 2)\n}\n```\n\nwhere `N` denotes the number of times a student has attended class and `N_max` \ndenotes the maximum number of classes where attendence was taken.\n\n# Exercises\n\nThere will be _no_ formal homework assignments this semester. Instead, there \nwill be  **five** to **eight** different excerise sets that will be made \navailable throughout the semester that students are highly encouraged to do. \nPlease note, that the exercises are done without a solution key being\nmade available.\n\n# Exams\n\nThere are **two** exams for this course. The first exam is a midterm that is \nworth **20%** and the second exam is a final exam worth **25%** that takes\nplace at 8:00-11:00 a.m. on Monday, May 8. The midterm and final exam _may_ have\na take-home portion in addition to a traditional in class examination. \nIn such cases, the take-home portion would be due within 24-48 hours after the\nstart of the exam. The take-home portion of the exam may not be discussed with\nyour classmates.\n\n# Group Project\n\nDuring the semester, students are expected to work on a capstone project within \na group. The capstone project is meant to either showcase a newly implemented \nstatistical algorithms OR extend existing functions in pre-existing packages. \nExamples of past group projects have included: Data Cleaning Shiny Application, \nLinkedIn Connection Scrapper and Network Visualizer, and Visualization Support\nfor Probability Distributions. Students should choose a topic that interests\nthem but is reasonable to complete within the scope of the class. Due to the\namount of projects and the individual demands of each group's project, the\ncourse staff will only provide *advice* -- not code -- during Office Hours.\nFailure to have a working project by the time of the final presentation day \nwill result in a severe penalty.\n\nThe groups will be created using the [CATME](http://info.catme.org/) system.\nThe use of this system is meant to create **strong** groups that are able to \neffectively work together. Specifically, students will be grouped together by\nleadership styles, schedule availability and skill level. Each group will\nhave between 3 to 5 students.\n\nThere are four different phases of the group project: **Project Proposal Presentation**,\n**Progress Report Presentation**, **Final Project Presentation**, and \n**Final Project Report**. Each of the phases is worth **10%**  making the \noverall project grade **40%** of the course total.  At the end, students will be\nasked to perform peer evaluations of group members that may influence the grades\nof students who do not contribute equally to the group project. As a results, \nstudents should view project grades as being tentative.\n\n## Project Proposal Presentation\n\nThe project proposal presentation must be **5 - 7 minutes** in duration and\nconsist of no more than 12 slides (not including reference slides). \n\nWithin the group project proposal, students should answer the following\nquestions:\n\n1.\t**Problem / Topic:** \n    * What problem or topic are you addressing? \n    * Why is it interesting or important?\n    * What evidence supports this conclusion? \n2.\t**Idea:** \n    * What is your idea for addressing the problem or topic? \n    * Why is it original relative to prior work? \n    * Where did the idea come from?\n3.\t**Relevance:**\n    * How does your idea match with the course’s focus on statistical programming? \n4.\t**Method:** \n    * What is your general plan for realizing the idea? \n5.\t**Feasibility:** \n    * Is this project able to be completed before the end of the semester?\n    * What steps must occur to complete the project before the end of the semester?\n6.\t**Time Schedule and Work Division:** \n    * What is the work plan to accomplish the necessary tasks before the end of the semester?\n7.\t**Preliminary Work:** \n    * What have you done or learned anything so far for the project? \n8.\t**References:** \n    * Provide a list of papers or items you have read to write this proposal. \n\n## Progress Report Presentation\n\nThe project progress report presentation up should describe the present status \nof the project. The progress presentation must be **5 - 7 minutes** in duration\nand consist of no more than 12 slides. Specifically, the slides should address\nthe following points:\n\n1. How is the project progressing?\n2. What has been accomplished thus far?\n3. What have you learned? \n4. What issues have arisen?\n\nPlease **avoid** including code snippets. However, clear functional output is\nokay.\n\nThe score for the progress report is based on how much work has been completed \nsince the project proposal was initially submitted.\n\n## Final Project Presentation\n\nThere will be 15 minutes during class that is allocated to the presentation of\nyour project.  Please focus on the outcomes of the project. The score is based\nsolely on how well the project outcomes and methods used are conveyed. There\nshould be no more than 12 slides (not including references) in the presentation.\n\n## Final Report\n\nPlease prepare the final report using the following outline: \n\n1.\tIntroduction\n2.\tRelated Work\n3.\tMethod\n4.\tResults\n5.\tDiscussion\n6.\tConclusion\n7.\tReferences\n\nReports will be graded based upon project outcomes, the execution of methods \ndescribed, and writing quality.\n\n# Software\n\nThe course will use and present the **R** statistical computing language as well\nas different parts of C++ through [Rcpp](http://gallery.rcpp.org/). The \nintegrated developer environment that we will use to explore *R* is\n[RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) made by\n[RStudio Inc](https://www.rstudio.com). You are free to use any language you\nchoose, but the course staff will only be able to provide support for **R**. If\nyou would like to use another statistical computing environment, please alert\nthe instructor ASAP to discuss feasibility.\n\n# Course Grades\n\n| Type             | Percentage     | Total Points |\n|------------------|----------------|--------------|\n| Participation    | 15             | 15           |\n| Midterm Exam     | 20             | 20           |\n| Final Exam       | 25             | 25           |\n| Group Project    | 4 x 10         | 40           |\n| **Course Total** |                | **100**      |\n\n# Grading Scale\n\n| A+  | A   | A-  | B+  | B   | B-  | C+  | C   | C-  | D+  | D   | D-  |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| TBD | 96% | 93% | 90% | 86% | 83% | 80% | 76% | 73% | 70% | 66% | 63% |\n\nGrades are not curved or adjusted. This is not to dishearten students, but to \nlet them know that their grade is based on individual effort and not on \ncomparative effort.\n\n# Academic Integrity\n\nThe official University of Illinois policy related to academic integrity can be \nfound in Article 1, Part 4 of the Student Code. [Section 1-402 in particular \noutlines behavior which is considered an infraction of academic \nintegrity.](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-402.html) \nThese sections of the Student Code will be upheld in the STAT 385 classroom. \nAny violations will be dealt with in a swift, fair and strict manner. \n\nYou may discuss methods for completing the exercise assignments with other \nstudents, but the execution of these methods and the preparation of the document\nmust be done independently. Sufficient evidence of sharing results, collaborating\non written assignments, or simply relying on internet resources will result in a\nscore of 0 for the assignment. There can be no discussion with other students or\ncollaboration of any kind on the take-home exams.\n\nTo ensure that you do not violate the academic integrity policies, all code and\nsolutions should be prepared yourself. All code should be typed yourself,\n**not** copy and pasted. (Except for code provided in class or in the textbook.)\n\n\n# Changes\n\nThe instructor reserves the right to make any changes he considers academically\nadvisable. Such changes, if any, will be announced in class. Please note that it\nis your responsibility to attend the class and keep track of the proceedings.\n\nAlso, if changes are made... \n\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpE_xMRiCLE\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n",
